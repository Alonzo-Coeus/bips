==Abstract==
In this BIP I'am going to solve a problem that could destroy bitcoin (in other word's quantum computing). It Will Discribe 4 new quantum proof OP_CODES.

==Summary==
The 4 new OP_CODES are CheckSig's using the lamport signature algorithm.

* OP_LAMPORTCHECKSIG
* OP_LAMPORTCHECKSIGVERIFY

* OP_LAMPORTCHECKMULTISIG
* OP_LAMPORTCHECKMULTISIGVERIFY

Each 	OP_CODE has the same behaviour as it's ecdsa counterpart.

==Motivation==
To quantum proof bitcoin with a Lamport based signicticture system.

==Specification==

==Implementation==
