==Abstract==
In this BIP describes 4 new opcodes for quantum proofing the bitcoin system.

==Motivation==
The bitcoin protocool using escada for transactions is not quantum secure and this may allow coins held by a bitcoin user to be stolen so i plan to interduce a new set of OPCODES.

==Summary==
The 4 new OP_CODES are CheckSig's using a lamport signature inspired algorithm they will replace NOP4 to NOP7.

* OP_LAMPORTCHECKSIG
* OP_LAMPORTCHECKSIGVERIFY
Each of these OPCODES  will will have three inputs <sig> <merkle_witness> <root_public_key> (root_public_key is used as an address).

* OP_LAMPORTCHECKMULTISIG
* OP_LAMPORTCHECKMULTISIGVERIFY

==Specification==
===What We Will Use===
The signincture algorithm we use will be a version of lamport using hash ladders suggested by karlgluck [https://gist.github.com/karlgluck/8412807 here].
Also we  will use merkle trees to allow you to sign multipul times without indangering your bitcoins.
===Private Key Compression===
To Compress the private key we will use a Ripemd-160 Hash as a psuedo random genarator.
We will use a 512-bit seed for creating the private key but in main use users will use the 512-bit seed but you could use any size which .

===Public Key and Signicture Compression===
The hash ladder

===Multiple Use===
To Allow multiple use signictures we will
==Implementation==
===The Code===
I have started work on a implementation of this at https://github.com/Ansho-enigu/bitcoin/

i added 2 new files in crypto/
*lamport.h
*lamport.cpp

also i have added 4 new OP_Codes in the script interpreter

==Rationale==

===scaling===
this BIP must not be implemented until segwit is added and lightning is in use for most tx's.
otherwise this will have a negative effect on scaling for bitcoin.

===Transaction Script===
a normal transaction using this OPCODE would be.
 scriptPubKey <root public key> OP_LAMPORTCHECKSIGVERIFY
 scriptSig <sig> <merkle_witness>
