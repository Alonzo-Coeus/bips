==Abstract==
In this BIP I'am going to solve a problem that could destroy bitcoin (in other word's quantum computing). It Will Discribe 4 new quantum proof OP_CODES.

==Summary==
The 4 new OP_CODES are CheckSig's using a lamport signature inspired algorithm.

* OP_LAMPORTCHECKSIG
* OP_LAMPORTCHECKSIGVERIFY

* OP_LAMPORTCHECKMULTISIG
* OP_LAMPORTCHECKMULTISIGVERIFY

Each 	OP_CODE has the same behaviour as it's ecdsa counterpart.

==Motivation==
To quantum proof bitcoin with a Lamport based signicticture system.

==Specification==
===What We Will Use===
The signincture algorithm we use will be a version of lamport using hash ladders suggested by karlgluck [https://gist.github.com/karlgluck/8412807 here].
===Private Key Compression===
To Compress the private key we will use a xor Ripemd-160 as a psuedo random genarator.
We Will use a 512-bit seed for creating the private key but in main use users will use the 512-bit seed.

===Public Key and Signicture Compression===
The hash ladder
==Implementation==
I have started work on a implementation of this at https://github.com/Ansho-enigu/bitcoin/

i added 2 new files in crypto/
*lamport.h
*lamport.cpp

also i have added 4 new OP_Codes in the script interpreter
